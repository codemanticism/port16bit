PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

A very lightweight interpreted language designed to be run by my own runtime which has a less than 2KB of data. It is designed also to be efficient and to have the same level of control as languagse like C, C++ or Rust and yet be interpreted. I originally wanted to make this language as the language for a software that could dectect what your code is doing because inductive reasoning. It is supposed to extended thru extensions, libraries and dialects. I implemented it myself in C++ in less than a month working a lot on this language.

I still want to work on this feature where you could give it a .portc (PortCompiled) code which is executed by the Port Runtime and then it will give you source code back with things like comments and variable and function names. The way this feature is intended to work is thru a series of deductions which then produces something a description can be given to an AI large language model. For example, the AI is given the description F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) and it outputs "Fibonacci Sequence".

But as I got more into coding I really got into creating my own custom programming language as another project on its own.

I may one day implement more advanced features for the compiler like Just-In-Time compilation and others.

This language is actually faster at cauculating the Fibonacci numbers than Python but Python takes a shorter amount of time to display them to the screen.
